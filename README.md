## Cell Phone Hackathon

This was a two-day sprint in implementing full-stack methods to quickly design a functional e-com website. We populated a mongoDB database with cell phone models, and used Mongoose/Express to work with our data, functionally creating our own API for the cell phones. We connected to our front end with DOM manipulation and used axios calls.

In our first GA group project, we communicated to fairly delegate tasks and to keep ourselves organized while working to everybody's strengths. Hurdles arose with some GitHub pushes and pulls, and of course with Mongoose debugging, but we effectively were able to work through everything without any major issues.

The learning curve and time constraint was challenging, but satisfying. We submitted the project and are proud of what we acccomplished and learned. With more time, we would have liked to add user functionality and full CRUD capabilities, as well as more DRY code.
